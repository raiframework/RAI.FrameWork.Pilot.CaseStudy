# ðŸ“‚ RAI Framework Pilot: ETL Structure

Welcome!  
This repository supports the **Reflective Agile Intelligence (RAI) Framework** pilot project focused on **UN SDG-4: Quality Education**.  
We are building a robust and transparent ETL system to empower reflective learning environments through digital transformation.  
Explore our folder structure below to understand how data flows from raw inputs to refined insights.


## ðŸ§± Layered ETL Staging Model  
A structured method that organizes data files into clear stages of processing:



| Zone                                 | Function                          | Industry Equivalent    |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Original** (`1.Original.File.*`)   | Raw, untouched data               | ðŸŸ¤ Bronze Layer        |
| **Prepared** (`2.Prepared.File.*`)   | Cleaned/preprocessed data         | âšª Silver Layer         |
| **Load** (`3.Load.File.*`)           | Ready for database ingestion      | ðŸŸ¡ Gold Layer          |
| **Anomalies** (`4.Anomalies.Data.*`) | Tracked issues & validation flags | ðŸ”´ Rejected/Error Zone |

"The project implements a Layered ETL Staging Model, inspired by the Medallion Architecture, using clearly named folders to represent progressive stages of data refinementâ€”enabling traceability, debugging, and auditability throughout the ETL lifecycle."
