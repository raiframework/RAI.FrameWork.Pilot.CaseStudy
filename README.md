🌐 RAI Framework Pilot: ETL Structure

Welcome!
This repository supports the Reflective Agile Intelligence (RAI) Framework pilot project, aligned with UN SDG 4: Quality Education.
Our goal is to build a robust, transparent, and ethically aligned ETL system that empowers reflective learning environments through digital transformation and continuous feedback loops.

🧱 Layered ETL Staging Model

A structured Medallion-inspired architecture that organizes data into progressive stages, ensuring traceability, validation, and auditability across the ETL lifecycle.


| **Zone**                | **Function**                                           | **Industry Equivalent**    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **1. Original.File.***  | Raw, untouched data                                    | 🟤 **Bronze Layer**        |
| **2. Prepared.File.***  | Cleaned and preprocessed datasets                      | ⚪ **Silver Layer**         |
| **3. Load.File.***      | Data ready for ingestion into databases or dashboards  | 🟡 **Gold Layer**          |
| **4. Anomalies.Data.*** | Detected issues, rejected records, and validation logs | 🔴 **Error/Rejected Zone** |



“The project applies a Layered ETL Staging Model, inspired by the Medallion Architecture, using explicitly named folders to reflect each phase of data refinement—enabling traceability, debugging, and governance across the RAI data ecosystem.”

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

SQL Server / SSIS – Data modeling & ETL pipelines

Power BI / DAX – Visualization, dashboards, and KPI tracking

Python / Pandas – Advanced data transformation and validation

RAI Framework – Reflective Agile Intelligence methodology

GitHub – Version control, collaboration, and documentation

🔁 Continuous Reflection Loop

The RAI Data Warehouse supports iterative learning and continuous improvement through reflection cycles:

Compare planned vs. actual participation across events.

Identify data quality gaps and process inefficiencies.

Document findings in RAI-PCF reflective logs.

Adjust communication and engagement strategies based on evidence.

Each feedback cycle strengthens agility, trust, and intelligence within the learning ecosystem.

📈 Expected Outcomes

A fully functional RAI-aligned Data Warehouse built using the Medallion Architecture.

Enhanced data transparency, integrity, and traceability across reflective learning environments.

Dynamic Power BI dashboards supporting reflective, agile, and intelligent decision-making.

Scalable ETL blueprint adaptable to education, governance, and quality-management domains.

🧭 Ethical Governance & UN Alignment

Aligned with UN SDG 4 (Quality Education) and UN SDG 16 (Peace, Justice & Strong Institutions).

Respects data privacy, inclusivity, and accountability principles.

Encourages digital literacy and transparent learning analytics as part of sustainable transformation.
